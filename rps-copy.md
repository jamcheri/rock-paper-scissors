Fighting a dragon

The dragon has reached the gate
with his powers of Rock Paper Scissors he has untold powers of destruction
At the last minute
The local wizard gives you a potion
A breakthrough innovation that allows you to counter the dragon's attack 
You drink the potion and you feel a surge of energy coursing through your arms
The dragon nears, he can now sense your power
The dragon attacks!!!
What will you do? 

The dragon hurls a rock at you, you smother the rock with paper and the attack is neutralized! The kingdom lives happily ever after :)

The dragon hurls paper at you, you cut the paper with scissors and the attack is neutralized!

The dragon hurls scissors at you, you smash the scissors with rock and the attack is neutralized!

The dragon hurls a rock at you, your scissors get crushed by the rock. Everyone you know dies :(

The dragon hurls a rock at you, you throw a rock back and it's a draw... for now...
